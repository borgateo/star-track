# ‚≠êÔ∏è Star Track

A small client application for discovering trending repositories on GitHub.

- A list of the repositories created in the last 7 days with the most number of stars in github
  should be displayed and the user should be able to favourite them
- The favourited repositories should be visible either through a filter or in a different tab.
  Some basic info about the repo should be displayed, such as repo name, link to GitHub,
  description and number of stars.
- To keep things simple, the favourites won‚Äôt be sent back to GitHub‚Äôs servers but just
  stored locally (e.g localstorage, cookies etc...).
- The ability to filter the repos by the languages used would be an awesome addition to have
